# AI_PD_ClinicalModel
Parkinson’s disease risk prediction is associated with Lewy pathology and neuron density

# Requirements

* Python 3.7.7
* lightgbm                  2.3.1
* scikit-learn              0.22.1
* scipy                     1.3.3


# Getting Started
* 1- The python versions and libraries you have should meet above.
* 2- Get the code $ git clone the repo and install the dependencies
* 3- Execute below in the local repo directory,
1.
For 3 year predicted risk scores and labels;
python Repo_pred_3_year.py predictors_example.csv

For 5 year predicted risk scores and labels
python Repo_pred_5_year.py predictors_example.csv

Both py file would provide risk scores and labels to your local directory as csv file.
