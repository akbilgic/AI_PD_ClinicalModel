# AI_PD_ClinicalModel
Light Gradient Boosting model to predict Parkinson's disease at prodromal phase

# Requirements

* Python 3.7.7
* bayesian-optimization     1.0.1
* lightgbm                  2.3.1
* scikit-learn              0.22.1
* scipy                     1.3.3


# Getting Started
1- the python versions and libraries you have should meet above.
2- Get the code $ git clone the repo and install the dependencies
3- Execute below in the local repo directory,

For 3 year predicted risk scores and labels;
python Repo_pred_3_year.py predictors_example.csv

For 5 year predicted risk scores and labels
python Repo_pred_5_year.py predictors_example.csv

Both py file would provide risk scores and labels to your local directory as csv file.
